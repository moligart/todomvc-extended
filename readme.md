# Angular 2 with ES2015 • [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) - Extended (Coding Test)

## Extension highlights

- Double-clicking a task entry opens a modal with more detailed edit options.
- Tasks are sorted automatically by completion, completed date, priority, and title.
- Task priorities are color coded: High = red, Medium = yellow, Low = green.
- The user is prompted for a completed date upon task completion. The value defaults to today's date, but is optional and can be removed.
- Mass completing tasks defaults completed dates to today's date. Unchecking a task as completed removes its completed date.

## Implementation

To run the app, use

* `npm install --save`
* `npm run start`

http-server may need to be installed globally using

* `npm install http-server -g`
